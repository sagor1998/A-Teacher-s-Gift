<p>“Well, John, have you succeeded, to-day,
my son?”</p>

<p>“No, mother; I have been nearly all
over the town, and no one would take me.
But I think if you had been with me, I
should have stood a better chance. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
look so thin and pale, mother, somebody
would have felt sorry, and so have taken
me; but nobody knew me, and no one
saw you.”</p>

<p>It was a cold, bleak night, and John had
been out all day, “looking for a place.”
He had tried hard, until it was quite dark,
and then gave up, thinking his mother must
be tired of waiting for him.</p>

<p>John’s mother was a widow, and a very
poor one. She had kept herself by needle-work,
till a severe trial of sickness had confined
her to her bed, and she was unable to
do more. She told her little son to sit
down by the fire, while she got him some
food. The fire and the supper were very
scanty; but John knew they were the best
she could provide, and he felt that he would
rather share such a fire and such a supper
with so kind a mother, than sit at the best-filled
table with any body else who did not
love him as she did, and whom he did not
love as he did her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>After a few moments of silence, the boy
looked up into his mother’s face, and said,
“Mother, do you think it would be wrong
to ask my new Sabbath school teacher about
a place?” “No, my child, not if you have
no other time, and I think that he would be
a very proper person; at least, I should
think that he would be interested in getting
you a good place.” “Well, to-morrow is
Sabbath day, and when the class breaks up,
I will ask him.”</p>

<p>After reading a portion of God’s holy
word, the mother and her little boy kneeled
down together to pray. She asked God to
bless them with his Holy Spirit, that they
might truly repent of sin, and through faith
in Jesus Christ, obtain pardon. She prayed
that God would care for them as a father,
give them his rich grace, and do that which
he knew to be best for them, for Christ’s
sake.</p>

<p>“I feel happier now,” said John; “I was
so tired when I came in that I felt quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
sad;—did I look so, mother?” The
mother’s heart was full, and she gave her
boy a kiss, which was sweeter to him than
many words.</p>

<p>Next morning was the Lord’s day.
John’s breakfast was more scanty than
ever; but he said not a word about that,
for he saw that his mother ate very little
of it. But one or two sticks of wood were
left outside the door where it was kept, and
he knew that both food and fire might all
be gone before night. They had earned no
money to buy any thing for several days.
The sun was shining bright and clear, but
the air was very cold. The child had no
overcoat; but hastening to the school, he
was in his seat just as the superintendent
and his teacher entered.</p>

<p>“Who is that little pale-faced boy in
your class?” asked the superintendent of
the teacher. “His name is Jones. I intend
to visit him this very week. He is a
well-behaved boy.” “I should like to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
more about him,” said the superintendent,
“and I will speak to him after school.”</p>

<p>The superintendent did not forget him,
and when the class broke up, seeing him
linger behind the other scholars, went up
and spoke to him kindly. “You have
been here to school several Sundays, have
you not, my boy?” “Yes, sir; I came
just a month ago to-day.” “Had you ever
been to school before that time?” “Yes,
sir; before mother was taken sick, I used
to go to another school; but that was a
great way off, and when mother got well,
and you opened this new school, she brought
me here.”</p>

<p>“Well, did I not see you yesterday, looking
for a place in Water Street?” “I
was down there, sir, looking for a place.”
“Why did you not take that place which
the gentleman had for you in the large
shop?” “Because, sir, they kept open
shop on the Sabbath, and mother would
not wish me to work on the Lord’s day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“You did not keep the piece of gold
money that you found on the floor, as you
were coming into the street; why didn’t
you?” “Because it was not mine, sir;
and I thought that the gentleman of the
shop would find the owner sooner than I
should.”</p>

<p>“He did, my boy,—it was my money.
Did you not get a place yesterday?”
“No, sir; all the places were full, and nobody
knew me.” “Well, my boy, you may
go now, and tell your mother that you have
a place. Come to me very early in the morning—your
teacher will tell you where I live.”</p>

<p>John went home with his heart and his
eyes so full, that he could hardly see the
street, or any thing as he went along. He
knew that it would cheer his dear mother
very much, and so it did. That Sunday
evening John and his mother knelt down
together, and with tears of joy, they gave
thanks to God, who had not forgotten the
fatherless and the widow in their distress.</p>

<p>Willie Mortimer was a kind and affectionate
little boy, but he possessed a hasty
temper, which was ever leading him into
some harm. Here, you see, it has just led
him into trouble. In trying to get his
mother’s work box away from his sister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
he has dropped it, and all the things have
rolled about the floor.</p>

<p>His mother often urged him to strive to
govern it; and the big tears would dampen
his little cheeks, as he reflected upon the
misdemeanors which his temper ever urged
him to commit. He repented quickly of
his errors, but somehow, he could not
“<em>think enough</em>,” before his temper had
conquered him. He often desired to overcome
it, but felt discouraged sometimes.</p>

<p>One day, after much enjoyment, he came
to his aunt, with whom he was staying, and
said,—</p>

<p>“O, I’ve been so happy, and got along
so well to-day, without getting angry!”</p>

<p>“How so?” exclaimed his aunt, as she
smoothed his brown locks.</p>

<p>“I prayed this morning, before I came
out of my room, and said, ‘Lead us not
into temptation;’ and I think God hears
my prayer, and helps me to be good,”
said Willie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>A subdued light shone from Willie’s dark
eyes, as he so confidingly reposed in grace
and help from Heaven to overcome his
waywardness.</p>

<p>The sun bade the children all, yea, and
the fair earth, his accustomed “good night,”
while Willie still remained a conqueror over
his temper. As he clasped his hands in his
evening prayer, he thanked God for not
leading him into temptation, and with
abiding faith in the great Being of love,
he laid him down to sleep.</p>

<p>My dear young friends, we all are surrounded
with temptation, and like little
Willie, are possessed of human weaknesses;
and how much we need to pray, with earnest
faith,—</p>

<p>“Lead us not into temptation.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BIRDS">BIRDS.</h2>

<p>The birds, the dear, beautiful birds, that
come in the sweet spring time to build their
nests among the fresh green leaves and
fragrant blossoms of our home trees! How
glad we are to see them! The little children
love the birds. No <em>kind</em> and <em>gentle</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
boy will rob their pretty eggs or their tender
young. But you may be happy in
watching their graceful forms and varied
colors, as they glide through the air or
hop about on the ground. Our heavenly
Father made them, and they praise him in
their many toned songs. He feeds them,
and teaches us thus to trust in his care.
The God that provides for the birds will
not forget you, for the Saviour says, “Ye
are of more value than many sparrows.”</p>

<p>I always like to see children making acquaintance
with the birds. If they watch
their habits, they will learn some important
lessons. I have been interested in some
observations which a little friend of mine
has recently made, and which she has told
in her first school composition. It is as
follows:—</p>

<p>“My dear Schoolmates,—I would like
to tell you a story. A little chipping bird
built a nest on a peach tree, near our
kitchen window. It was a soft, pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
nest, lined with hair. A naughty little
wren, wishing to build herself a nest, instead
of looking about to find straws and
hair, comes every day and takes them
from the chipping bird’s nest. I think I
shall not love her as much as I did before.
I think I shall call her a little <em>thief</em>, instead
of a little wren. I think little children
should learn a lesson from the birds, and
not take what does not belong to them, for
they will be called thieves, and no one will
love them if they do.”</p>

<p>What a beautiful creature is the gaudy
butterfly! Children, you do not wish to
crush its golden wings, and destroy its brief,
sunny life. O, no; you had rather see it free
and happy. How cruel and wicked it is for
children to destroy these beautiful creatures
which God has made!</p>

<p>Here is a story in regard to a little boy
and a butterfly.</p>

<p>“I was walking along through a pretty
village, one summer day. The cottages
were covered with woodbines and roses.
The bees were busy carrying home honey
to the hives, while the children were playing
about so happily. I was thinking how soon
the bright summer would be gone, and the
leaves fallen from the trees, when a little
boy ran by, chasing a beautiful butterfly.
I was sorry to see him soon catch it, and
hold it fast in his hand. I asked him if he
knew how cruel and unkind it was. He
said,—</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; I wanted it, to take home
and put under a glass; it looks so very
pretty. I did not know it would hurt it.”</p>

<p>But when I told him how much pain it
gave the poor creature, he opened his little
hand to let the butterfly escape.</p>

<p>Alas! poor thing, it was so hurt it could
not fly at all; so we were obliged to kill it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
to put it out of pain. The little boy was
very sorry; so were the other children who
had gathered round.</p>

<p>Then I showed them the dust upon the
wing, and told them if we could only see it
distinctly, how it would look almost like
feathers, and how it hurt the poor creature
to have it brushed off. I explained to them
about the caterpillar, and that some of them
spin beautiful webs, and then come the butterflies,
which fly about in the bright sunshine,
but die when winter comes.</p>

<p>Then we talked about the great God,
who made all these beautiful creatures, and
how he loved dear children to be kind to
one another, and to poor dumb animals that
could not tell when they were in pain.</p>

<p>Children may run about the fields, and
gather the beautiful flowers, and bright
green ferns; which the little boys and girls
said they would do, and never catch butterflies
any more, but only watch them fly
about, so happily basking in the sunshine.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TWO_PICTURES">THE TWO PICTURES.</h2>

<p>Will you look at two pictures, and see
if either one belongs to you?</p>

<p>The first is of a little boy. I will not tell
you his name, nor his age, nor where he
lived, nor who are his parents. I am sure
he would not like to be known; but I must
tell you about him, that you may avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
his faults, and take good warning by his
conduct.</p>

<p>This little boy has a kind mother, and
she wishes that he should grow up to be a
useful and pious young man. Yet, sad to
tell, he does not himself care to do right,
or to obey his parents, or to please God.
There can be no doubt that he has a very
hard and wicked heart; for when he is
naughty, and grieves his mother, he does
not care for her tears. And when he is
told of a fault, he is stubborn, and will not
ask to be forgiven, nor show any desire to
amend.</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who came into
the world to die for sinners, was once a
little child. He has left a pattern for children
who wish to be like him. As a child
he was “subject in all things.” He never
grieved his mother’s heart by a sullen or
evil temper, nor made her shed a tear by
any unkind conduct. O, how much did
Mary love the holy child Jesus! But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
little boy of whom we write does not wish
to be like Jesus. He does not love to hear
about him as a kind Saviour. I do not
think he ever truly prays to God to change
his hard heart, and to give him the grace of
his Holy Spirit, that he may be a better
child. He may say his prayers, but he does
not really pray, for he does not mean what
he says, but is looking about him all the
time he is on his knees, or is thinking of
something else.</p>

<p>What is to become of this little boy, if
he does not seek for grace to turn him
from his evil ways? He will certainly
grow worse. He will walk in the path
of the wicked all the days he lives on
earth; and then, when he dies, how sad
will his end be!</p>

<p>Now, let us look at another picture. It
is that of a little boy who obeys his parents,
because it is right, because they love him,
and because God has said, “Honor thy
father and thy mother;” one who is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
careful to obey them when out of sight as
when under their eye. There are several
lads seen standing at the corner of a street.
One proposes to the rest that they should
all go and see the people on their way to
the flower show. “O, yes! capital! so we
will!” they all cried. “But, see, here is
William Hall coming; let us ask him to go
with us.” Then they said, “Come with us,
William, and see the gentlemen and ladies
at the flower show.” “Yes,” said William,
“if my mother will give me leave: I will run
and ask her.” “O, O! the baby!” they
shouted aloud; “so you must run and
ask your mother!” “I did not ask my
mother,” said one boy. “Nor I,” said two
or three more. “Come along with us,”
they still said, “if you do not want to be
called a coward as long as you live. Do
you not see we are all waiting?”</p>

<p>William stood with one foot forward, and
a flush on his face. Tears came into his
eyes, as he heard the word “coward.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Now was the time to see if he was brave
enough to be called a coward, rather than
do wrong. “I <em>will not</em> go without I first
ask my mother,” said he, firmly, “and I
am no coward either. I promised that I
would not go out of the street without she
gave me leave; and I should be a coward
if I were to tell a wicked lie.” The rest
now ran away, mocking and shouting; and
William went quietly to his home. In the
evening William was seen, with a happy
face, taking a pleasant walk along with his
dear mother.</p>

<p>Will you look at these two pictures, and
see if you can find your own likeness in
either? Are you like the boy who does
not honor his parents? Then you do not
fear God nor obey his word, and he is angry
with you every day. Or, are you like him
who would rather have the scorn and bad
name of the rude lads than disobey his
mother?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_BAD_SIGN">A BAD SIGN.</h2>
</div>


<p>This boy is trying to get that poor dog
into the water.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a> He seems to delight in
tormenting the poor creature.</p>

<p>Now, this is a bad sign. It is a bad sign
for a boy to be seen throwing stones at
every dog, or pig, or bird he sees in the
street. It shows that such a boy has an
unfeeling heart. He does not care how
much suffering he may cause a poor, innocent
bird, or animal. What if he breaks a
wing or a leg—he only laughs at the agony
which he has caused.</p>

<p>Boys, never cultivate such a cruel disposition.
Never cause any thing, that has
feelings, pain, if you can possibly help it.
I am afraid if you begin with tormenting
the poor, innocent brutes, you can, after a
while, injure your playmates and associates.
Some have already been seen to throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
stones at poor boys just for the fun of it, or
rather, to gratify the evil disposition of their
hearts. Ah! many men have been hung
for murder, or sent to the state’s prison,
just because they cultivated such bad dispositions
when they were boys like you. They
commenced becoming cruel to animals first,
and then to other boys, and so, little by
little, their hearts became hardened, till they
could even kill a man. Think of this the
next time you are tempted to pick up a
stone to throw at any innocent thing that
has life and feeling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PENKNIFE">THE PENKNIFE.</h2>

<p>Charles Hart had once the folly to steal
his father’s penknife; he had sold it for six
cents to one of his schoolfellows; and he
had employed the money in purchasing
cherries, which he ate with much appetite.</p>

<p>But this little pleasure, which lasted but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
a few minutes, was followed by sorrow and
regret, that continued a long time.</p>

<p>In short, Charles’s theft was not long in
being found out. His schoolfellow’s father,
having seen the penknife in his son’s hand,
and having learned of whom he had bought
it, sent it back immediately to Charles’s
father, with a polite message to know if he
had given his son leave to sell it.</p>

<p>You may easily conjecture that young
Charles was severely punished; but the punishment
which he received from his father
was trifling in comparison with what followed.</p>

<p>All those who lived in the same house
with him suspected him the moment that
they happened to miss any thing; and each
accused him of having taken it. They
rummaged his pockets, room, books, and
carried their suspicions so far, as to inquire
at the school where Charles went, if he had
not shown any suspicious thing there.</p>

<p>Judge if this sort of distrust did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
cause him uneasiness. He often cried most
bitterly at the injustice they did him; though
he felt that he had but too well deserved it.
Let him say what he would of their wronging
him, or let him assert that he was incapable
of doing what they accused him of,
they did not continue to mistrust him the
less; nor was it till after many years, and
that he had given strong proofs of his
amendment, that the people with whom he
lived restored him their confidence.</p>

<p>Did you ever think to be thankful to
God for the free use of your feet? They
press lightly o’er the crisp snow, or bound
o’er the green grass as you drive along your
hoop. But let me tell you of one who can
never run and jump. When the busy hours
of school are passed, and his little companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
shout and toss their hats in air, with
the wild joy of boyhood, <em>he</em> stands apart
from the busy throng; the same quiet,
patient look ever rests on his face, he
moves slowly along with his crutches. O,
what would he not give to throw them aside
and join in the sports of childhood! What
real delight would he feel in the exercise
of the powers which you possess!</p>

<p>A sad feeling ever passes through my
heart when I see our little lame boy; and
O, how thankful I am that I am not thus
afflicted! And how thankful should you
be, and how very kind should you be to the
unfortunate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLOWERS_AND_WEEDS">FLOWERS AND WEEDS.</h2>

<p>Arthur and Jane had each a little garden
of their own, which had been given to
them by their kind father. He told them
that they must take care to pluck out all
the weeds, and to do all they could to make
the flowers grow. They used to save some
of their money in the winter, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the spring came, they spent it in buying
seeds and roots.</p>

<p>When the little leaves and stems began
to peep above ground, Arthur and Jane
watered them every day; and as the plants
grew, they took care to keep them free from
all insects, and to shade them when the sun
shone too strongly. They made a nice path
of gravel between the beds, which they kept
quite smooth and clean. In the afternoon,
as soon as they came home from school,
they used to run into the garden to see to
their sweet flowers. With all this care the
beds looked very pretty when summer came.</p>

<p>But there was one thing which gave them
a good deal of trouble. Weeds would
spring up. Almost as fast as they were
plucked up in one place, they grew in
another.</p>

<p>“I do not like those ugly, naughty
weeds,” said Jane to her mother. “They
must not grow in my pretty garden. I want
only sweet flowers to be there.” “Yes,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
added Arthur, “I am sure we have tried
our best to keep them out, but they will
grow in spite of us.”</p>

<p>“It is just like other little gardens,” said
their mother, “in which I wish to see only
flowers; but I am sorry to say I have seen
many weeds thrive there, though much labor
has been given to keep them out.”</p>

<p>“What little gardens are they, mother?”</p>

<p>“Those over which I have watched, and
in which I still hope to see some useful and
lovely plants, though I have not yet quite
gained my wish. I have often thought I
could see a few buds, but they have not
come into full blossom. And sometimes
where I had hoped to find a flower, I have
only plucked a weed.”</p>

<p>“But where are these gardens?”</p>

<p>“These gardens are your young hearts,
my dears. You know I have wished to see
there what I would call my pleasant flowers.
One of these is Kindness; and a very large
and fine plant it is when fully grown; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the weed of Selfishness too often springs up
around it, until it is quite covered from our
view. This ill weed will spread in all directions,
and twine itself about every stalk
that comes in its way. Humility is a very
pretty flower. It does not make much show,
for like the sweet violet it hides itself among
its own leaves. If you mark it well you
will see its delicate and sweet-smelling blossoms.
But there are tall and showy weeds
called Pride and Vanity, which, though they
please some eyes, are very hurtful to the
flowers. Truth is another plant in these
gardens, but the hurtful weed of Falsehood
will come up by its side, and cause it soon
to wither and die. Then there are other
flowers, known by the names of Industry,
Contentment, and Peace, which are much
admired by all who see them; but the
naughty weeds of Idleness, Sullenness, and
Anger often choke the nice plants before
they are fully grown.”</p>

<p>“O, I see, mother, what you mean now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
The flowers are good tempers and conduct,
and the weeds are our wicked passions and
evil ways.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Arthur, and you
should know that the evil of your hearts is
friendly to the growth of these hurtful weeds.
Gardeners say that it is always needful to
keep young plants clear from all weeds,
which twine round the roots, and stop their
growth. You see, then, why I have tried
to root out all evil which I have seen in
your conduct, or to cut it down; but I have
felt that the Holy Spirit must renew your
hearts. We must watch, and pray, and labor;
yet only the Spirit of God can so
change these little gardens of your hearts
as to make ‘the plants of grace’ grow and
flourish in them.”</p>

<p>“You said to us, dear mother, that if we
ask God to give us his Holy Spirit, he will
hear and answer our prayer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, Jane; and I hope you and
your brother will not forget the lesson I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
then taught you. Then I shall see in you
those flowers which, of all others, are the
most lovely that can be found in the human
heart. There will be the precious blossom
of faith; you will look to Jesus as your
Saviour, who died for you on the cross; and
you will make him all your trust. The
sweet plant of Love will flourish too: you
will yield yourselves to God, and love him
because he first loved you. And blooming
Hope will appear in all its beauty; you will
look forward to the happy time when you
shall be removed from the Lord’s garden on
earth, the church of Christ, to flourish in
his heavenly courts forever.”</p>

<p>How many living things there are in the
world besides boys and girls, and men and
women! Some of them have legs, and they
creep and run on the ground; some have
fins, and they swim in the water; and some
have wings, and they fly in the air.</p>

<p>If God had not been very wise he would
not have known how to make so many live
things unlike each other, and if he was not
very good he would never have made them
so happy. See how the gnat sports in the
sun! Hark! how the bird sings in the air!</p>

<p>God has made all things just as they
ought to be made. What would the bird
do with fins? he could not swim with them.
What would the fish do with wings? he
could not fly with them,—he would, indeed,
be “like a fish out of water.”</p>

<p>If a cow had wings, what a fright she
would be to look at in the air! I would
run and hide myself; would not you? Why,
if she came down, and fell upon us, she
would crush us and kill us. There is a
picture, in a book that I have, of a horse
with wings; but that is all fancy. A horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is very swift, but swift as he is, he does not
fly. No, no! Let people say what they
like,</p>

<p>The other day, when the sun was very
bright, I saw some gnats at play under a
tree. How they did fly up and down!
Well, all at once, what should one of them
do but settle on my nose! when I spoke
to him—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O, O! Mr. Gnat,</div>

</div>

<p><span style="margin-left: -1em;">Soon he flew away again, and began to play</span>
as before.</p>

<p>I once heard of a gnat that teased a lion
half out of his senses. What the lion had
done to make him angry I do not know.
No doubt you wonder that the lion did not
kill him; but he could not. The gnat flew
close to his eyes, and sat on his nose, and
flew away again every time the lion lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
up his great paw. If the little gnat was
able to plague the great lion, let us act
kindly to all, for we see that the weak may
vex the strong. The best way is to live in
love with every one; and the Bible says

</div>

<p>Just as I came away from the tree an old
horse went under it. Poor thing! his hip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
bones stood up very high. I could almost
count the number of his ribs; and one of his
legs a little above the hoof was a great deal
bigger than it ought to have been.</p>

<p>In less than a minute all the gnats were
flying about the old horse. He laid down
his ears, and shook his head, and then he
lifted up one of his feet and struck his iron
hoof on the ground. He did not like the
gnats to be about his eyes and ears, any
more than I did to have one on my nose.
At last the old horse walked away; some of
the gnats went with him, and the rest began
their game again under the tree.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Hark! do you not hear a loud buzz? It
is the large blue fly there that makes it.
Now he is on the beam above me, with his
head down and his heels up; now he is flying
about the room. I cannot follow him
with my eyes, he flies so fast. There! what
a bang he gave the window pane with
his head! Flies are very swift on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
wing; they fly faster than a horse can
gallop.</p>

<p>An odd tale has been told, which I will
tell you. A bear and a man once acted
kindly one to the other. The man fell
asleep on the ground, but he had not much
rest, for a fly would settle on his face.</p>

<p>“O,” thought the bear, “I will do a kind
deed for my friend. I will kill the fly that
teases him.” With this, he lifted up his
great, heavy paw; but, alas! in killing the
fly he tore with his claws the face of the
man also.</p>

<p>Let us learn a lesson from this tale. Let
us take care that every kind act we do is
done in a proper manner, or we may
do very little good, or do a great deal of
harm.</p>

<p>Then let us not be cruel to any of the
creatures God has made, whether they fly
in the air, swim in the water, or creep and
run on the ground. We ought not to ill
use any thing, not even the poor snail that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
goes along the ground so slowly, with his
house on his back,—</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>


<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
